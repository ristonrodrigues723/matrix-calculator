Matrix Calculator Website
https://ristonrodrigues723.github.io/matrix-calculator/

This repository contains the source code for a web-based matrix calculator. The calculator allows users to perform various operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion. Users can define matrices with custom dimensions and enter a mathematical equation using matrix variables.

Features:

Matrix Input: Users can create matrices of different sizes (up to 5x5) by specifying the number of rows and columns.
Matrix Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices.
Matrix Inversion: Calculates the inverse of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix (if invertible).
Identity Matrix Insertion: Allows quick insertion of 2x2 and 3x3 identity matrices.
Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for invalid user input or unsupported operations.
Step-by-Step Calculation: Displays the intermediate steps involved in the calculation for better understanding.
Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, calculations, and dynamic content updates.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/maximusimperious/matrix-calculator.git
Use code with caution.

Open in a Web Browser: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Customization:

This is a basic implementation and can be further customized. You can:

Extend support for larger matrix sizes.
Implement additional matrix operations like transpose or determinant.
Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.
